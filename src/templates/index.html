  <h3>Welcome to Vyxapedia!</h3>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal/">Vyxal</a> is a recreational programming language created by <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/78850/lyxal">lyxal</a> for code golf, a competition to write the shortest code to complete a certain task. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming">stack-based</a> programming language and is inspired by <a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/#/">J</a>, a practical tacit language.</p>
  <p>Vyxal uses a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBCS">Single Byte Character Set (SBCS)</a>, so each of its characters take one byte (this is important as code golf is usually scored in bytes, and not characters). You can run Vyxal on lyxal's own <a href="https://lyxal.pythonanywhere.com">online interpreter</a>, or the interface on this site <a href="/tio">here</a>, which uses its API.</p>

  <h5>How to get started</h5>
  <p>Vyxal is easier to get into than most golfing languages as it is designed to be more elegant and readable, and it includes components from practical languages as part of its design philosophy; however, mastering it requires just as much skill and experience as any other language. If you are completely new to stack-based programming and Vyxal, a good place to start is the <a href="/beginners">beginners' page</a> under the resources tab. There are other resources available for documentation and lessons ranging from introductory to more advanced. Finally, you can find help in the <a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/106764/vyxal">Vyxal</a> chat room on Stack Exchange; however, you will need a Stack Exchange account to send messages in that room.</p>
