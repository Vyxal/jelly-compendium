  <h3>Character Page - <code>Â¶</code></h3>

  <p>Pilcrows can be substituted for newlines (<code>\n</code>) - they translate to the same byte internally. It is recommended to use pilcrows in literals and newlines to separate links, as this makes code clearer. Outside of literals, a newline begins a new link (line of code). The last link is the main link, which is executed when the program is run.</p>
