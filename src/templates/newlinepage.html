  <h3>Character Page - Newline</h3>

  <p>Outside of literals, newlines function identically to spaces and do not carry any special meaning. However, they can make your code more readable (but less golfy, of course) and separate tokens - for example, <code>12</code> is the number literal twelve, and <code>1 2</code> is two literals, one and two.</p>
