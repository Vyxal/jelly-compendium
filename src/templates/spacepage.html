  <h3>Character Page - <code>&nbsp;</code></h3>

  <p>Outside of literals, spaces do not carry any special meaning. However, they can make your code more readable (but less golfy, of course) and separate tokens - for example, <code>12</code> is the number literal twelve, and <code>1 2</code> is two literals, one and two.</p>
