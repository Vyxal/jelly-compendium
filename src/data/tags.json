  "arguments": "Built-ins that relate to link/chain arguments or command line arguments to the program.",

  "bitwise": "Built-ins that manipulate the bits (binary representation) of its argument(s).",
  "boolean": "Built-ins that process or manipulate boolean values, or are logical operators (as opposed to bitwise). In Jelly, booleans are represented as <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.",
  "combinatorics": "The broad mathematical field of counting in relation to finite structures. As an unexhaustive list, enumeration, determining existence, and construction of structures satisfying some condition are part of combinatorics.",

  "matrix": "Built-ins that create, process, or manipulate 2D array / lists of values (they do not have to be rectangular).",
  "number": "Built-ins that primarily manipulate numeric values (not including built-ins that require a number but primarily manipulate other data; for example, array indexing).",

  "random": "Built-ins with non-determinstic / random behavior.",
  "register": "The register is a global value that can be accessed and manipulated across the program.",
  "stdio": "Built-ins that read from STDIN or output to STDOUT. This is usually not idiomatic and takes more bytes, but can be golfier in specific circumstances.",
