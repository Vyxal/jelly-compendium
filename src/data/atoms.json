    "description": "Given a list, multiply all of its values together (left-reduce by `×`). Errors for multiple string inputs; however, it is able to repeat strings so long as only one string is present. Beware that repeating strings via multiplication causes them to become multi-character Python strings, which Jelly cannot work with. See ||misc|jellystrings|| for more information.",
